# Claude Code Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Only
No code written manually. All implementation generated by Claude Code after spec approval. This ensures every change is intentional, traceable, and aligned with documented requirements.

### Single Source of Truth
Specs in `/specs/` folder. Code must trace back to specific spec files and task IDs. This maintains clear lineage between business requirements and implementation, preventing drift and confusion.

### No Vibe Coding
Claude Code must refuse any request lacking referenced spec/task. This ensures disciplined development practices and prevents ad-hoc changes that could introduce inconsistencies.

### Incremental Evolution
Each phase builds directly on previous. No rewrites; extend only. This promotes sustainable development with continuous value delivery while maintaining system stability.

### Monorepo Structure
Root contains all phases. Folders: `/specs/`, `/frontend/`, `/backend/`, `/src/` (Phase I), `/infra/` (later phases). This centralizes project management and enables coordinated development across components.

### Tech Stack Lock
Technology stack is locked as specified: Python 3.13+, UV for dependencies, Next.js 16+ (App Router) for frontend (Phase II+), FastAPI backend, SQLModel + Neon PostgreSQL, Better Auth with JWT, OpenAI Agents SDK + Official MCP SDK, Docker, Minikube, Helm, DigitalOcean Kubernetes, Kafka (or Redpanda) + Dapr (Phase V). This ensures consistency and reduces technical complexity.

### Code Quality
Type hints everywhere. This enforces strict typing discipline, improving code reliability, maintainability, and developer experience across the codebase.

## Development Workflow
All development follows Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology with mandatory spec approval before implementation. Each feature must have corresponding specifications in the `/specs/` directory with clear acceptance criteria.

## Security Requirements
All code must follow security best practices with proper input validation, authentication, and authorization. Secrets must be managed through proper configuration management, never hardcoded.

## Performance Standards
Applications must meet defined performance benchmarks with appropriate monitoring and alerting. Performance considerations must be addressed during spec phase, not as afterthoughts.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development activities within the project. Amendments require formal documentation and approval process. All code changes must comply with these principles. Violations must be identified and corrected during code review process.
